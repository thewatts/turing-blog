Hey Jeff,

First off - major props on writing more blog posts. It's a hard thing to be consistent at, and you've got a nice little release cycle going on :)

Secondly, I think this blog post is incredibly important. From an outsider's perspective - I have no idea what the process is. And to be honest, as someone who sees what you're trying to accomplish, and sees how the industry as a whole does its thing - 
I just automatically assumed that taking investment money was something that would happen. Clearly, it's a *rare* thing that Turing isn't taking investment dollars - and it's for good reason. Doing so would put you in the position to have to compromise the _why_ of what you're doing.
In this post, you're fighting for what you believe in - the whole vision of Turing - to make lasting change in the lives of the students and in the community, providing opportunities and fostering legitimate long-term change.

And anything that would compromise that, just isn't worth it for you (and shouldn't be).

I feel the tone of the piece is not your intent though.
Reading this, I feel that you sat down to write after a meeting that went awry, or a heated conversation. You're passionate and making a stand for your beliefs, and no one is going to tell you otherwise.
And because of that feel - it's hard to see why you're even writing the post. It makes it seem like a knee-jerk reaction.

That's not your heart, as Jeff Casimir or Turing. And *I* know that, because I know you, and I've had the incredible opportunity to be a part of what's happening.

So, I don't want to just point out things and not provide a solution - because that doesn't really help.
And seriously - no hard feelings if you think I'm full of it - but here are my 2 cents on how you could potentially restructure things a bit to still educate, stand strong on the vision, and provide a way for people to still get involved:

---

1. "You may have heard that we're trying to do all those things without investment dollars, but why?"
    - "You may be thinking: 'Couldn't you do that more effectively with investment dollars? Reach more people, hire more teachers?'"
    - the scoop about what taking investments means to a school.
        - lower quality teachers
        - worse experience
        - money that could be going toward education, having to go back into investor pockets

2. What's the vision?
    - "We're not in this to get rich, we're in this to make change"
    - what are you trying to do?
        - empower lasting change
        - add diversity and remove ignorance
        - provide opportunites for those who normally have none
        - impact a culture for the better

3. Why those 2 things won't mix
    - **What's right for investors is orthogonal to what's right for students**.
    - "Though we could do this, we won't. We won't sacrifice what we're trying to do."
    - "And in the tech world, they're looking for 10x return on investment. If they put in 18 million dollars they're shooting for a payout of 180 million."
    - "I've made compromises on my beliefs in the past, and I paid a huge price. It won't happen again. This is our chance to do it right."

4. The resolve - "we will take investment dollars - from those who trust us to do what we do best, and who expect a different kind of return: Change in the community and lives of others."

I should walk away from the post like "Man, those guys are legit - and are really in it for the students", instead of "Man, that guy is passionate, but he's writing because he's pissed."

Not sure if that helps at all. I would just hate for you to burn people, or turn people away, because of the tone of the post.

You may have seen that Turing is organized as a non-profit, expecting approval
as a 501(c)(3) from the IRS within the next 10 months. I frequently then get the
question *"how's that working out for you?"* And the answer is *"it's difficult."*
The paperwork, the accountability, not qualifying for things like SBA loans - the hoops
we're made to jump through to get this thing off the ground are as many as the prospect is
exciting.  Yes, I'm familiar with [B Corps](https://www.bcorporation.net/what-are-b-corps),
but they're not the same.

A big part of the 501(c)(3) decision was about investment -- **I'm against it**. I
bootstrapped [Jumpstart Lab](http://jumpstartlab.com) in 2009, so doing the same
with Turing just made sense. But if you look around you'll find developer education
programs taking investment left and right, some in the tens of millions of dollars.

That's a *big problem*. Investors don't give money away, *they expect it back*.
And in the tech world, they're looking for 10x return on investment. If they put
in 18 million dollars they're shooting for a payout of 180 million.

If you're running a software or content business, that works. Khan Academy or
Coursera can parlay investment dollars into new content that can reach millions
of learners -- that's awesome. If they're each willing to pay a few dollars then
the investors can hit their 10x no problem while realizing the educational goals.

But we're not in the content business, we're in a services business. Classrooms
don't scale in the same ways as software and content.

So where does the 10x return come from in a classroom setting? **Student tuition**. 
For every dollar an investor puts in they want *ten student dollars back*. 
That tuition paid into the system, instead of paying for instructors and facilities, 
pays investors. It compels the school to raise tuition and cut costs, raising the
student/teacher ratio and settling for less experienced instructors. Money sucked out of the 
ecosystem, diverted to the investors.

**What's right for investors is orthogonal to what's right for students**. If we claim
to be focused on the best possible outcomes for our students *and* take investment, then 
we're lying to one side or another. And the side with the "little guy" will lose.

Is it hard to bootstrap while watching competitors take on huge investments? Of
course. But this is too important. I've made compromises on my beliefs in the past,
and I paid a huge price. It won't happen again. This is our chance to do it right.

And no outsider, regardless of how deep their pockets, will call the shots.
